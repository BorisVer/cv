                    Supporting the operations of the bicycle shop, I primarily specialized in electric scooter tire replacements while also aiding in bicycle maintenance. My time there provided me with valuable experience in inventory management, and I particularly liked physicality of work. Occasionally I also did customer service within the store and made follow-up calls.

                    I worked as a personal assistant, providing support to individuals who faced challenges with daily tasks. My responsibilities included assisting them with tasks such as grocery shopping, moving heavy objects around the house, going for walks, and other daily activities where they required assistance.

                <p> <!--text-->
                    I worked as a salesperson and stock replenisher at Lidl. I greatly enjoyed the stocking and warehouse tasks, as they where more physically challanging. At the checkout, I learned to deliver good customer service even in rush hours. My time at Lidl also provided me with the opportunity to operate electric pallet jacks and similar equipment, stock shelves, and collaborate with a large group of colleagues and work independently.

                <p> <!--text-->
                    I worked as a collector in the warehouse, operating a small forklift to collect items from one place and transport them to another, either onto a cart or pallet, and then deliver them to the dispatch area. Occasionally, my duties also involved maintaining the cleanliness of the warehouse and unloading goods from trucks. I like the physicallity of the work but disliked the lack of human interactions.

                    My current position involves a lot of work for different companys. Mainly property maintanace and construction work. In the winter I clear snow from yards, and more from place to place with a variety of vehicles like delivery vans, flatbeds and work marchines/tractors. This role has allowed me to refine my skills in operating different vehicles and allowed me to learn how to plan days on my own.

                <p>
                    I started my degree of computer science in the fall of 2023. I am excited to work both in my field of interest and in other roles to gain experience and learn more about the kind of work that I enjoy. I work well with people, and I am quick to learn new skills. In my free time, I enjoy working out at the gym and tinkering with my car.

                    I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the University of Helsinki. I am constantly learning new high and low-lever programming languages. Because I am in my first year of university, I have yet to actively participate in university organizations and student boards. However, during my time in high school, I served as the Vice President of the school's student board, where I honed my skills in event organization, meeting management, and financials.
